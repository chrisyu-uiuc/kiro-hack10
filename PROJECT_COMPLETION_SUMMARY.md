- **Security**: CORS, Helmet security headers, input validation, API key management
- **Performance**: Multi-layer caching, request deduplication, performance monitoring
- **Development Tools**: Hot reload, TypeScript, ESLint, comprehensive logging

### Frontend (React/TypeScript)
- **Enhanced User Flow**: City input → Interactive spot selection with detailed popups → Itinerary display
- **Spot Information Popups**: Rich modals with photos, reviews, ratings, and practical information
- **Interactive Photo Galleries**: Optimized image loading with lazy loading and caching
- **Mobile-Optimized Interface**: Touch-friendly with swipe gestures and responsive design

- **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, and screen reader support
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety across all components with Google Places types

### API Integrations
- **AWS Bedrock Agent Service**: Configured for region us-east-1 (Agent ID: BTATPBP5VG, Alias: JFTVDFJYFF)
- **Google Places API**: Complete integration for photos, reviews, ratings, and practical information
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when external services are unavailable
- **Error Recovery**: Smart retry logic with exponential backoff for API failures
- **Caching Strategy**: Multi-layer caching (memory + session storage) for optimal performance

## 🚀 How to Run

### Development
1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm run install:all
   ```

2. **Configure environment:**
   - Copy `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env`
   - Add your AWS credentials and Google Places API key

3. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # Or use the enhanced restart script:
   ./restart-servers.sh
   ```
   - Backend: http://localhost:3001
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000

### Production Deployment
For AWS EC2 deployment with Ubuntu 24.04 LTS:
```bash
# Automated setup on EC2 instance
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-username/your-repo/main/deployment/ec2-setup.sh
chmod +x ec2-setup.sh
./ec2-setup.sh
```

## 🧪 Testing

- **Backend Tests**: 100+ tests covering all API endpoints, AWS integration, Google Places integration, and error scenarios
- **Frontend Tests**: Comprehensive component testing including mobile interactions and error boundaries
- **Test Coverage**: Unit tests for services, routes, middleware, components, utilities, and error handling
- **Mobile Testing**: Touch interactions, swipe gestures, and responsive behavior
- **Performance Testing**: Caching, optimization, and memory management verification
- **Run Tests**: `cd backend && npm test` (backend), `cd frontend && npm test` (frontend)
