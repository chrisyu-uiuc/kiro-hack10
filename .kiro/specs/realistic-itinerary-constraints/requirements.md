# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Realistic Itinerary Enhancement modifies the existing Travel Itinerary Generator to produce more realistic itineraries with proper time allocations, travel times, and logistical considerations. The system enhances the current AWS Bedrock Agent prompts to generate itineraries that include realistic visit durations, travel times between locations, and practical scheduling without changing the existing user interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a traveler, I want the generated itinerary to include realistic time allocations for each attraction, so that I can plan my day properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system generates an itinerary THEN it SHALL include specific visit durations for each selected spot based on attraction type
2. WHEN calculating visit times THEN the system SHALL allocate 1-2 hours for museums, 30-60 minutes for viewpoints, 2-3 hours for parks, and 1-1.5 hours for landmarks
3. WHEN displaying the itinerary THEN the system SHALL show start and end times for each activity
4. WHEN planning the schedule THEN the system SHALL ensure activities fit within reasonable daily hours (9 AM to 8 PM)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a traveler, I want the itinerary to include realistic travel times between locations, so that I can understand how long it takes to get from one place to another.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system generates an itinerary THEN it SHALL include estimated travel times between consecutive attractions
2. WHEN calculating travel times THEN the system SHALL consider walking time for nearby locations (under 1km) and public transport time for distant locations
3. WHEN displaying travel information THEN the system SHALL specify the transportation method (walking, metro, bus, taxi)
4. WHEN planning the route THEN the system SHALL account for travel time in the overall schedule timing

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a traveler, I want the itinerary to be logically organized to minimize unnecessary travel, so that I can visit attractions efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system generates an itinerary THEN it SHALL group geographically close attractions together in the same time period
2. WHEN organizing the schedule THEN the system SHALL minimize backtracking by following a logical geographic flow
3. WHEN multiple attractions are in the same area THEN the system SHALL schedule them consecutively
4. WHEN planning multi-day itineraries THEN the system SHALL organize each day around specific neighborhoods or districts

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a traveler, I want the itinerary to include practical breaks and meal times, so that the schedule is realistic and comfortable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system generates an itinerary THEN it SHALL include designated meal breaks (lunch and dinner times)
2. WHEN scheduling activities THEN the system SHALL include 15-30 minute buffer times between attractions for transitions
3. WHEN planning long days THEN the system SHALL suggest rest breaks every 3-4 hours of activity
4. WHEN meal times are included THEN the system SHALL suggest restaurants or dining areas near the current location

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a traveler, I want the enhanced itinerary to work with the existing user interface, so that I can benefit from realistic planning without learning a new system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user completes spot selection THEN the system SHALL use the enhanced prompting to generate realistic itineraries
2. WHEN displaying the itinerary THEN the system SHALL show the enhanced timing information in the existing ItineraryDisplay component
3. WHEN the itinerary is generated THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with the current API response format
4. WHEN users interact with the system THEN the enhanced features SHALL work seamlessly with the existing three-step flow
