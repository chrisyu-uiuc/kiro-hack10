# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Update Bedrock Agent prompt to request realistic timing
  - ✅ Modified the generateItinerary method in BedrockAgentService.ts to include timing requirements in the prompt
  - ✅ Added instructions to the prompt asking for specific visit durations, start/end times, and travel times between locations
  - ✅ Request the agent to group nearby attractions together and include meal breaks
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 3.1_

- [x] 2. Enhance ItineraryDisplay component to show timing information
  - ✅ Updated ItineraryDisplay.tsx to display any timing information that comes back from the enhanced prompt
  - ✅ Show start/end times, visit durations, and travel information if present in the response
  - ✅ Added simple styling to make timing information clear and readable
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 2.3, 4.1, 5.4_

- [x] 3. Add basic error handling for enhanced responses
  - ✅ Added try-catch around the enhanced prompt to fall back to original behavior if it fails
  - ✅ Ensure the existing itinerary display still works even if timing information is missing
  - ✅ Log any parsing issues for debugging without breaking the user experience
  - _Requirements: 5.3, 5.4_

- [x] 4. Test the enhanced prompts with real data
  - ✅ Tested the updated prompts with Tokyo and Paris spot combinations - excellent response quality
  - ✅ Verified enhanced prompts generate realistic timing with proper durations, travel times, and lunch breaks
  - ✅ Confirmed fallback behavior works correctly when enhanced prompts fail
  - ✅ All 81 tests passing, enhanced features working as expected
  - _Requirements: All requirements validation through testing_
