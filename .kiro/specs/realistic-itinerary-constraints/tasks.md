# Implementation Plan

- [ ] 1. Update Bedrock Agent prompt to request realistic timing
  - Modify the generateItinerary method in BedrockAgentService.ts to include timing requirements in the prompt
  - Add instructions to the prompt asking for specific visit durations, start/end times, and travel times between locations
  - Request the agent to group nearby attractions together and include meal breaks
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 3.1_

- [ ] 2. Enhance ItineraryDisplay component to show timing information
  - Update ItineraryDisplay.tsx to display any timing information that comes back from the enhanced prompt
  - Show start/end times, visit durations, and travel information if present in the response
  - Add simple styling to make timing information clear and readable
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 2.3, 4.1, 5.4_

- [ ] 3. Add basic error handling for enhanced responses
  - Add try-catch around the enhanced prompt to fall back to original behavior if it fails
  - Ensure the existing itinerary display still works even if timing information is missing
  - Log any parsing issues for debugging without breaking the user experience
  - _Requirements: 5.3, 5.4_

- [ ] 4. Test the enhanced prompts with real data
  - Test the updated prompts with various spot combinations to see response quality
  - Adjust prompt wording based on what works best with the Bedrock Agent
  - Verify the frontend displays the enhanced information correctly
  - _Requirements: All requirements validation through testing_
